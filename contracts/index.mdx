## CompositeERC1155

_An abstract contract that extends LockableERC1155 and provides functionality for composite ERC1155 tokens.
Composite tokens can be "composed" from multiple underlying assets, which however do not change their owner
and in contrast to that use LockableERC1155 standard, which allows to read locked asset BalanceOf, OwnerOf methods correctly_

```

### _burn

```solidity
function _burn(address from, uint256 id, uint256 amount) internal

### decompose

```solidity
function decompose(address from, uint256 id, uint256 amount) public virtual
```

_Decomposes a composite ERC1155 token into its individual components.
This function unlocks the specified amount of the composite token from each dimension,
and then burns the specified amount of the composite token from the caller's balance._

#### Parameters

```

_Burns a specified amount of tokens from the given account.
This will burn all underlying (composite) assets

Requirements:
- `account` must be the token owner or an approved operator.

## EIP712

_https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712[EIP 712] is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data.

The encoding specified in the EIP is very generic, and such a generic implementation in Solidity is not feasible,
thus this contract does not implement the encoding itself. Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding
they need in their contracts using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`.

This contract implements the EIP 712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding
scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA
({_hashTypedDataV4}).

The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating
the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.

NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as "v4", as implemented by the JSON RPC method
https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask].

_Available since v3.4.__

### constructor

```solidity
constructor() internal
```

_Initializes the domain separator and parameter caches.

The meaning of `name` and `version` is specified in
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#definition-of-domainseparator[EIP 712]:

- `name`: the user readable name of the signing domain, i.e. the name of the DApp or the protocol.
- `version`: the current major version of the signing domain.

NOTE: These parameters cannot be changed except through a xref:learn::upgrading-smart-contracts.adoc[smart
contract upgrade]._

### _domainSeparatorV4

```solidity
function _domainSeparatorV4() internal view returns (bytes32)
```

_Returns the domain separator for the current chain._

### _hashTypedDataV4

```solidity
function _hashTypedDataV4(bytes32 structHash) internal view virtual returns (bytes32)
```

_Given an already https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#definition-of-hashstruct[hashed struct], this
function returns the hash of the fully encoded EIP712 message for this domain.

This hash can be used together with {ECDSA-recover} to obtain the signer of a message. For example:

```solidity
bytes32 digest = _hashTypedDataV4(keccak256(abi.encode(
    keccak256("Mail(address to,string contents)"),
    mailTo,
    keccak256(bytes(mailContents))
)));
address signer = ECDSA.recover(digest, signature);
```_

## LibCoinVending

_This library is used to simulate the vending machine coin acceptor state machine that:
 - Supports large number of positions; Each represents requirements to acess different goods of the virtual vending machine.
 - Accepts multiple assets of following types: Native (Eth), ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 tokens that can be stacked together.
 - Allows for each individual asset action promise can be one of following:
     - Lock: The asset is locked in the acceptor with promise that asset will be returned to the sender at release funds time.
     - Bet: The asset is locked in the acceptor with promise that asset will be awarded to benificiary at release funds time.
     - Pay: The asset is locked in the acceptor with promise that asset will be paid to payee at release funds time.
     - Burn: The asset is locked in the acceptor with promise that asset will be destroyed at release funds time.
 - Maintains each position balance, hence allowing multiple participants to line up for the same position.
 - Allows three actions:
     - Fund position with assets
     - Refund assets to user
     - Consume assets and provide goods to user
     - Consuming asset might take a form of
     - Transferring assets to payee
     - Burning assets
     - Awarding beneficiary with assets
     - Returning locked assets back to sender

This library DOES enforces that any position can only be refunded or processed only within amount funded boundaries
This library DOES NOT store the addresses of senders, nor benificiaries, nor payees.
This is to be stored within implementation contract.

 !!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!
This library does NOT invocates reentrancy guards. It is implementation contract's responsibility to enforce reentrancy guards.
Reentrancy guards MUST be implemented in an implementing contract.

 Usage:

 0. Configure position via configure(...)
 1. fund position with assets via fund(...)
 2. release or refund assets via release(...) or refund(...)
 3. repeat steps 1 and 2 as needed.
 Position can be recofigured at any time when it's effective balance is zero: `timesFunded - timesRefuned - timesReleased = 0`

Test state:
This library most functionality has been tested: see ../tests/LibCoinVending.ts and ../tests/report.md for details.

ERC721 token is checked only for "HAVE" condition since putting requirements on non fungable token id yet to be resolved.

- When `from` and `to` are both non-zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens
of token type `id` will be  transferred to `to`.
- When `from` is zero, `amount` tokens of token type `id` will be minted
for `to`.
- when `to` is zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens of token type `id`
will be burned.
- `from` and `to` are never both zero.
- `ids` and `amounts` have the same, non-zero length.
