# What is Game Master protocol?

Implements an optimistic intermediatory signer for submitting temporary anonymous proposals on chain.

## Definitions

- `GM` - Gam master: an off-chain server or human who submits and signs transactions upon request
- `Proposer` - EOA that submits a proposal messages to
- `Proposal` - 32 bytes data
- `Turn` - Proposals batching in to a block (one proposal per sender)
- `GM Contract` - on chain protocol piece that is set to trust a particular GM

## Workflow

For each turn there can be set of Proposals as well as set of Votes except for first and last trun. Votes are submitted for a previous turn proposals. Hence on first turn only propisals can be sumitted and at last turn no proposals is accepted.

**Proposing: **

0. For each turn alculates **salt** as hashed combination of own private key & nonce
1. protocol user, **proposer**: sends to GM a message (via private communication channel) containing data to post to chain and his signature that enables game master to do so.
2. GM Takes that message and calculates anonymous proposer identificator by hashing proposer address with turn **salt**
3. GM submits (using own gas) data on-chain together with anonymous proposer identificator in to contract that implements GM Contract

**Voting**

0. Voter sends his vote for some of proposals active in the turn to GM. GM returns back hash of the vote with the salt.
1. Voter then submits this hash to GM Contract. GM contract validates voter address as well as GM signature.
2. Upon turn end GM submits a transaction that contains not only revealed proposers, but also a revealed voters

** Upon end of turn**

GM submits another transaction to GM Contract. This tx contains revealed proposers addresses as well as **salt** used in that turn. GM Contract then runs signature verification logic and ensures that revealed proposers addresses indeed matches to anonymous indentificator and that the proofs were really generated by revealed proposers.

## Payments

In order for Game Master to sign or send transactions it has to be funded. It is still to be implemented but basically GM operator will be taking fee by supporting these operations

## Privacy

It is up for GM operator to guarantee user data privacy. It can be done trough service level agreements OR by building GM on a TEE based technologies such as iExec.
